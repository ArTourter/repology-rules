<!--
Please consider submitting a pull request instead, for it can be
processed faster.

You'll need to add a rule to corresponding (based on first letter
of a target project name) section of

https://github.com/repology/repology-rules/tree/master/800.renames-and-merges

Use existing rules as example or read more extensive documentation at
https://github.com/repology/repology-rules#rule-syntax
-->

<!--
Note that we do NOT merge:
- Modules (e.g. python) without consistent prefix (e.g. python- or
  python3-) (common problem for Slackbuilds and Debian source packages).
-->

**Source projects**

<!--
Please add links to Repology projects which needs to be merged
-->

**Preferred target project**

<!--
Please pick a preferred target project name, if it's not obvious
and if you have reasons for one
-->

(no preference)

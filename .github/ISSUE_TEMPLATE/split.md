<!--
Please consider submitting a pull request instead, for it can be
processed faster.

You'll need to add a rule to corresponding (based on first letter
of a project name) section of

https://github.com/repology/repology-rules/tree/master/850.split-ambiguities

Use existing rules as example or read more extensive documentation at
https://github.com/repology/repology-rules#rule-syntax
-->

<!--
Note that we do not split:
- Different versions (or legacy/ESR branches) of the same project
- *-unclassified projects - these lack homepage information, and
  will be split automatically as soon as repositories provide it
-->

**Source project**

<!--
Please add a link to Repology project which needs to be split
-->

**Target projects**

<!--
Please list some information on target projects it needs to be
split into, such as names or homepages.
